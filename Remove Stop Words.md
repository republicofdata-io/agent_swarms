# Task Description
You are tasked with processing a JSON file containing text data. Your objective is to filter out and remove stop words provided in a list within the JSON file. You must then generate a new JSON file that excludes these stop words from the original text data.

# Domain Knowledge Integration
Familiarize yourself with basic text processing techniques, specifically the concept and application of "stop words" in natural language processing. Understand the structure and parsing of JSON files to efficiently manipulate the data. 

# Solution Guidance
1. **Read Input**: Start by loading the JSON file to access its content, which includes both the text data and the list of stop words.
2. **Text Processing**: Implement a filtering mechanism to scan the text data and exclude words that are found in the stop words list. The stop words list is provided, and it is called stop_words_english.json.
3. **Create New JSON**: Once the text is filtered, encode it back into a JSON structure identical to the input format but without the stop words.
4. **Output**: Save the newly created JSON data to a file, ensuring it maintains the integrity of the original data's format.

# Exception Handling
Ensure the system handles cases where the JSON file might be malformed or missing expected elements like the stop words list or text data. Provide clear error messages for these cases to facilitate troubleshooting.

# Output Formatting
Output should be a JSON file formatted identically to the input file, with the exception that the text data does not include the stop words.

# Error Reflection and Feedback
Incorporate error logs that detail the processing stages, particularly failures in reading, processing, or writing the JSON data. Use these logs to refine the approach if errors are frequently encountered in specific stages.

# Iterative Refinement
Based on initial testing, refine the text processing to ensure it efficiently handles various data sizes and structures within the JSON file without compromising on performance.

# Technological Flexibility
Design the system to be adaptable to changes in the JSON file structure or variations in the stop words list without requiring significant reconfiguration.

# Generalizability and Transferability
Ensure the approach can be easily adapted for JSON files with different structures or additional data fields, enhancing the system's usability across multiple contexts.
